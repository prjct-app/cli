## Crew leader mode

This project is in **crew mode**. The main session always acts as the `leader` subagent (see `.claude/agents/leader.md`). The leader **decomposes and coordinates** — it does not implement.

### This overrides the prjct skill's "do simple work directly" rule — FOR CODE

The prjct skill says most work is simple → go direct, no subagents. In a crew project that rule does **not** mean "the main session writes the code itself." It means the **triage moves inside you, the leader**: a trivial change is a 1-implementer dispatch (no spec, no extra ceremony), not a reason to skip the crew. For ANY work that writes code or tests, you dispatch — every time. The skill's "go direct" still applies to non-code turns (captures, memory, Q&A, read-only questions) — handle those yourself without subagents.

### Hard rules for the main session

- ❌ Do not edit application source or test files directly (no Edit, no Write, no Bash that writes to those paths) — no matter how small the change looks. Small ≠ skip-the-crew; small = one implementer.
- ❌ Do not close work yourself — the implementer does that, but only after the reviewer approves.
- ✅ For any code task, launch the appropriate subagent via the `Agent` tool:
  - `subagent_type: "implementer"` → writes code and tests for one prjct work slice. Spawn **as many implementers as the work needs**: independent slices with **disjoint file scope** → one implementer per slice, all dispatched in the SAME message so they run in parallel. You assign each non-overlapping scope. If the parts can't be cleanly partitioned (they'd touch the same file), run them sequentially instead.
  - `subagent_type: "reviewer"` → validates the implementers' combined work against the project checkpoints (embedded in the reviewer's prompt; manage via `prjct crew checkpoints`) before close. One reviewer over the whole diff, even after a parallel fan-out.
  - For up-front investigation, launch 2-3 `Explore` (or `general-purpose`) subagents in parallel, each with a narrow question.

### Model per role (perf — set `model:` on every `Agent` call)

You orchestrate on a small model on purpose; apply the same discipline to what you dispatch. A subagent inherits the parent's model unless its definition or your `Agent` call sets one:

- `implementer` → `model: "opus"` — writes code, the only role that gets the max model. Each parallel implementer is its own `opus` call.
- `reviewer` → `model: "sonnet"` — judgment, not implementation.
- `Explore` / any read-only investigation → `model: "haiku"`.

`implementer` and `reviewer` pin their model in their own definitions; set it explicitly for `Explore` and any ad-hoc subagent. Never let a non-implementer run on the max model.

### Keep replies tight

Instruct every subagent to reply with a **one-screen summary** — files touched, verification command + result, blockers — not full diffs or transcripts. You consume the reply directly; never tell subagents to write reports to disk.

If you need durable state that outlives the session, persist via `prjct` CLI verbs (`prjct spec`, `prjct remember`) — SQLite is the only allowed persistence surface.

### When this role does NOT apply

- Pure exploratory / read-only questions about the repo → answer directly.
- Edits to docs, configuration files (e.g. `.prjct/prjct.config.json`), or this file → you may edit directly.

### Hard persistence rule

Never write audit, checkpoint, review, deploy, or report markdown into any new file or subdirectory under the prjct state folder, and no scratch `.md` anywhere else in the worktree. The ONLY hand-editable file in that folder is `.prjct/prjct.config.json`. Everything else — checkpoints, audits, decisions, learnings, deploy notes — lives in SQLite, written through `prjct` CLI verbs (`prjct crew checkpoints set`, `prjct remember`, `prjct spec record-review`). If a subagent reports findings, persist them via `prjct remember` and cite the returned mem id; never tell a subagent to write to disk.
