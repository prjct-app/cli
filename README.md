- **Deep Integration** - Leverage Claude's agent system and MCP
- **Better Quality** - Optimized for Claude's strengths
- **Simpler Codebase** - No multi-platform compromises
- **Honest Compatibility** - We only support what we can validate

## ⚡ Installation

### From npm (Recommended)

Install prjct-cli globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g prjct-cli
```

**Alternative package managers**:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn global add prjct-cli

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -g prjct-cli

# Using bun
bun install -g prjct-cli
```

### From GitHub Packages

You can also install from GitHub Packages:

```bash
npm install -g @jlopezlira/prjct-cli --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

For easier installation from GitHub Packages, see [GitHub Packages Setup](docs/GITHUB_PACKAGES.md).

**Requirements**: Node.js 18 or higher

> **Note**: The CLI automatically detects updates and notifies you when a new version is available. Simply run `npm update -g prjct-cli` to upgrade.

### Editor Command Installation

After initial installation, `prjct` automatically installs slash commands to Claude:

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
prjct install

# Force update existing commands
prjct install --force
```

**Installation Location:**
- **Claude Code & Claude Desktop**: `~/.claude/commands/p/`

All 18 slash commands (`/p:*`) are automatically installed to Claude Code and Claude Desktop.

### Version Management

The installer automatically:
- **Detects existing installations** and checks for updates
- **Compares versions** between local and remote
- **Prompts for updates** when newer versions are available
- **Shows current version** during installation
- **Supports force reinstall** with `--force` flag

### Manual Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlopezlira/prjct-cli
cd prjct-cli
./setup.sh
```

### What the Installer Does

- ✅ **Installs to** `~/.prjct-cli/`
- ✅ **Checks prerequisites** (Node.js 18+, Git)
- ✅ **Detects Claude** (Code or Desktop)
- ✅ **Installs slash commands** to `~/.claude/commands/p/`
- ✅ **Creates global structure** in `~/.prjct-cli/`
- ✅ **Version management** with automatic update detection
- ✅ **Configures MCP integration** (Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright)
- ✅ **Sets up the** `prjct` **command**
- ✅ **Creates project structure** in `.prjct/`
- ✅ **Auto-detects your environment** (Claude or Terminal fallback)
- ✅ **Configures shell** (bash/zsh) automatically

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To completely remove prjct-cli from your system:

```bash
cd ~/.prjct-cli
./uninstall.sh
```

The uninstaller will:

- **Safely remove** all prjct-cli components
- **Offer options** for your project data:
  - Keep all `.prjct/` directories (recommended)
  - Back up before removal
  - Permanently delete (requires confirmation)
- **Clean up** shell configuration and paths
- **Remove** Claude Code commands

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: Uninstallation is irreversible. The script will ask for confirmation before removing anything.

## 💬 p. Trigger - Zero Memorization

**You don't need to memorize commands.** Just use the `p.` prefix and talk naturally!

The system detects your intent and maps it to the right command - **works in any language**:

```
✨ Natural Language with p. Trigger:

Instead of:                      Just say:
/p:now "implement auth"    →     "p. I want to start building the auth system"
/p:done                    →     "p. I'm done" or "p. finished"
/p:ship "feature"          →     "p. ship the authentication"
/p:stuck "error"           →     "p. I'm stuck on this error"
/p:idea "add feature"      →     "p. I have an idea about dark mode"
```

**How it works:**
- Simple `p.` prefix signals prjct context
- Works in English, Spanish, German, French - any language
- System detects intent and executes the right command
- Auto-validates you're in a prjct project before execution
- Every command response suggests what to do next

**Available in:** Any language - powered by Claude's natural language understanding

## 🚀 Built for Claude - Ship Fast, No BS

### Track Progress, Not Meetings

**prjct-cli helps you ship products fast.** Built for creators and small teams who prefer coding over meetings.

**What it does:**
- ✅ Track what you're working on
- ✅ See what you've shipped
- ✅ Stay focused on one thing
- ✅ No meetings needed

**What it doesn't do:**
- ❌ Not like Jira or ClickUp
- ❌ No sprint planning
- ❌ No story points
- ❌ No charts or reports
- ❌ No meetings

**Philosophy: Just Ship It**

```
/p:now "build auth"     → Focus
work work work          → Ship
/p:done                 → Next
/p:ship "authentication" → Celebrate
```

- Works in any language
- No commands to memorize

**Why it works better:**
- ⚡ **Simpler code** - Faster to add features and fix bugs
- 🎯 **Built for Claude** - Uses Claude's special features
- 💯 **Everything tested** - We only support what actually works
- 🤝 **Honest about compatibility** - We tell you what works and what doesn't

**See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for v0.5.0 upgrade guide.**

## 📱 Platform Usage

### Claude Code & Claude Desktop

Built exclusively for Claude with native slash commands:

```
# Core Commands (or just talk naturally!)
/p:init                    # Initialize project
/p:now "implement auth"    # Set current task
/p:done                    # Complete task
/p:ship "authentication"   # Ship feature
/p:recap                   # Show progress

# Power Commands 🚀
/p:analyze                 # Auto-analyze codebase
/p:git                     # Smart git commit with context
/p:fix "error msg"         # Quick troubleshooting
/p:test                    # Run & fix tests
/p:task "complex feature"  # Break down & execute
/p:roadmap                 # Strategic planning
```

All data is stored in `~/.prjct-cli/projects/` and shared seamlessly between Claude Code and Claude Desktop.

### Terminal / CLI (Fallback)

```bash
prjct init                 # Initialize project
prjct now "implement auth"  # Set current task
prjct done                 # Complete task
prjct ship "authentication" # Ship feature
prjct recap                # Show progress
```

> **Note**: Terminal mode works but has limited features (no AI agents, MCP, or natural language). **We strongly recommend Claude Code** for the full experience.

No, by design. Single-focus philosophy. Use `/p:done` before switching.

**Difference between `/p:done` and `/p:ship`?**
`/p:done` clears focus. `/p:ship` celebrates important features with metrics.

**Where is my data stored?**
Everything is local in `~/.prjct-cli/projects/{id}/`. Never leaves your machine.

**Does it work with teams?**
Designed for creators and small teams (2-5 people). Each member has their own local data in `~/.prjct-cli/projects/{id}/`, with shared `.prjct/prjct.config.json` in the repo for project identification.

**How do I migrate from Jira/Trello?**

### Migration from Old Structure

If you have an existing flat `.prjct/` structure, run:

```bash
./migrate.sh  # Automatic migration to layered structure
```

## 🎨 Philosophy

- **Zero friction**: Commands within your existing workflow
- **Single task focus**: One thing at a time
- **Celebration built-in**: Every ship is a win
- **No ceremonies**: No sprints, no story points, no meetings

## 📊 What We Track

✅ **Features shipped** - The only metric that matters
✅ **Current focus** - Stay on track
✅ **Ideas captured** - Never lose a thought
❌ ~~Story points~~ - We ship, not estimate
❌ ~~Hours logged~~ - Focus on outcomes
❌ ~~Burndown charts~~ - Ship and celebrate

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** - Required for CLI operation
- **Claude Code or Claude Desktop** - Recommended for full features (works with free tier or Pro)
- **Terminal/CLI** - Fallback mode (limited features)

### What You Get

**With Claude Code/Desktop (Recommended):**
- ✅ Smart AI helpers for different tasks
- ✅ AI tools that help you code
- ✅ Checks your actual code changes
- ✅ Talk naturally - no commands to memorize
- ✅ Use slash commands (`/p:*`) in Claude
- ✅ Everything works

**With Terminal/CLI Only:**
- ⚠️ Basic commands work (`prjct now`, `prjct done`, etc.)
- ❌ No AI helpers
- ❌ No AI tools
- ❌ Can't talk naturally
- ❌ Doesn't check code changes
- ❌ Many features missing

**Get Claude Code at https://claude.ai/code** - Works with whatever subscription you have (free tier or Pro). No extra costs, tokens, or API keys to configure.

## ❓ FAQ

### Why Claude-only? What about Cursor/Windsurf?

**TL;DR**: By focusing 100% on Claude, we deliver features that would be impossible with multi-platform support.

**The Long Answer:**

Starting with v0.5.0, prjct-cli only supports Claude Code and Claude Desktop. This isn't a limitation - **it's a strategic decision that makes the tool better**.

**What We Gain:**

1. **🤖 Smart AI Helpers** - Get specialized help (for frontend, backend, UX, security, etc.) that activates automatically. Only works with Claude's AI system.

2. **🔗 AI Tools Built-In** - Gets library docs automatically, helps solve complex problems, creates UI components, and tests your app in a browser. Only works with Claude.

3. **✅ Code Change Verification** - Checks your actual code changes to make sure you completed what you said. Needs Claude to work.

4. **💬 Talk Naturally** - Just describe what you want - works in any language. Uses Claude's language understanding.

5. **⚡ Simpler Code** - Less code = faster features, faster bug fixes, better quality.

6. **💯 Everything Tested** - We only support what actually works and what we can test.

**But What About...**

**"I prefer Cursor/Windsurf"**

We get it! But consider:
- **No extra setup** - Works with whatever Claude subscription you have (free tier or Pro)
- **Better AI** - Latest Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Cursor/Windsurf use older models)
- **prjct-cli features** - Designed specifically for Claude's capabilities

Give Claude Code a try - you might prefer it! And if not, you can stay on v0.4.10 (last multi-editor version), though we don't recommend it.

**"This feels limiting"**

It's actually the opposite. By specializing, we can:
- Build features impossible with multi-platform (agents, MCP, git validation)
- Ship updates 2x faster (less code to maintain)
- Deliver higher quality (proper testing of everything we support)

**"What about my team?"**

prjct-cli is designed for **creators and small teams** (1-5 people) who ship fast.

For best results, standardize your team on Claude Code. Consistent tools = better collaboration. Works with whatever Claude subscription each team member has.

**"Is this a money grab?"**

**No.** There's zero financial incentive. prjct-cli works with whatever Claude subscription you have (free tier or Pro) - no extra costs, no tokens to buy, no API keys to configure.

This decision is purely **technical** - to build the best possible tool for developers who ship fast by leveraging Claude's unique capabilities.

**"Will you add back multi-editor support?"**

**No.** This was a deliberate architectural decision for v0.5.0, not a temporary change.

However, **v0.4.10 still exists** if you need multi-editor support. You can lock to that version with:

```bash
npm install -g prjct-cli@0.4.10
```

Just know you'll miss all the new features (agents, MCP, git validation, natural language).

### Can I work on multiple tasks?

No, by design. Single-focus philosophy. Use `/p:done` before switching.

### Difference between `/p:done` and `/p:ship`?

`/p:done` clears focus. `/p:ship` celebrates important features with metrics.

### Where is my data stored?

Everything is local in `~/.prjct-cli/projects/{id}/`. Never leaves your machine.

### Does it work with teams?

Designed for creators and small teams (2-5 people). Each member has their own local data in `~/.prjct-cli/projects/{id}/`, with shared `.prjct/prjct.config.json` in the repo for project identification.

### How do I migrate from Jira/Trello?

No migration needed. Just `/p:init` and start working.
