/**
 * Hook stdin spill — recovery channel for the native hook-fast punt.
 *
 * The installed hook command is a shell `||` chain (see
 * core/services/hook-command.ts): native hook-fast → runtime+shim →
 * portable `prjct hook X`. Once hook-fast has READ stdin, the next stage's
 * stdin pipe is drained — a naive `||` fallback would silently run with an
 * empty payload. hook-fast therefore SPILLS the payload to a deterministic
 * scratch file in the daemon run dir before punting (exit 89, no output),
 * and every portable stdin reader below checks for a fresh spill first:
 *
 *   <runDir>/hook-stdin-<fnv1a32hex(cwd)>-<subcommand>.json
 *
 * Deterministic (no pid, no env hand-off) because a C process cannot export
 * env vars to the next command in the chain — both sides must compute the
 * path independently. The fnv1a-32 hex of the cwd UTF-8 bytes is mirrored
 * byte-for-byte in native/hook-fast.c; change one, change the other.
 *
 * Collision note: two concurrent sessions in the SAME cwd firing the SAME
 * subcommand share one spill path. Acceptable — a spill only exists when
 * hook-fast already failed, the loser overwrites the winner's identical-
 * shaped event payload, and the next real hook fire regenerates context.
 *
 * Freshness: consumers accept a spill only when its mtime is within
 * HOOK_STDIN_SPILL_MAX_AGE_MS (the shell starts the fallback the moment
 * hook-fast exits, so a legit spill is milliseconds old) and UNLINK it on
 * read, so a stale spill from a crashed chain can never hijack a later,
 * unrelated hook fire's stdin.
