/**
 * Review lenses — the SHARED specialist roster.
 *
 * The multi-agent review is NOT a fixed trio. Specialists are composed from the
 * concern a change actually raises: `architecture` is the floor; the rest join
 * when the work signals them. The vocabulary is OPEN — any lowercase string is a
 * valid lens (an agent-invented specialist gets the generic rubric).
 *
 * Both `spec-audit-dispatch` (audit the plan) and the crew (review the diff)
 * draw from this one catalog, so "the specialists you need" means the same set
 * everywhere — no predefined-personas anti-pattern.
