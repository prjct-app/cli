 *      command/workflow, a skill recipe, gates), then PERSIST them via prjct
 *      verbs. prjct describes; the host does the LLM work and persists.
 *   2. STEAL-A-RIG — adopt an existing open-source rig as the Body's base.
 *      prjct emits the adoption plan (which organs to install, via which verbs).
 *
 * Both are pure renderers (no execution) — the anti-harness contract: prjct
 * names WHERE the work lives + the verbs to persist it; the host runs it.
