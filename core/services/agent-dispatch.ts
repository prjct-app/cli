/**
 * Provider-aware multi-agent dispatch — the harness runs on ANY rig.
 *
 * prjct's multi-agent flows (audit-spec, review fan-out) emit dispatch
 * instructions; the host executes them. Claude Code has a native subagent tool,
 * so it dispatches real parallel subagents. Other rigs (Gemini, Codex, …) have
 * no subagent tool, so the same fan-out is EMULATED on a single agent: run each
 * unit as a fresh, isolated pass. Either way the per-role model comes from the
 * sovereignty policy via the live-rig bridge — so the architecture, not just
 * the prose, is portable across brains.
