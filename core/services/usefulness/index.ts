/**
 * Memory reinforcement ledger — "prjct gets smarter the more it's used."
 *
 * Recall already ranks by relevance (BM25 / semantic) and recency. What it
 * lacked was a memory of WHICH knowledge actually pays off. This service
 * accumulates a per-entry `usefulness` score from deterministic usage
 * signals and feeds it back into the ranking:
 *
 *   - reference  — a newly captured entry cites an older `mem_N`
 *                  (resolves / relates / supersedes / inline mention). The
 *                  cited entry is load-bearing knowledge the project keeps
 *                  building on → strong positive signal.
 *   - fetch      — an entry was pulled by id on purpose
 *                  (`prjct context memory mem_N`) → weaker positive signal.
 *
 * Scores TIME-DECAY (half-life): knowledge that stops being used fades from
 * the ranking boost on its own, so the system tracks what is useful NOW, not
 * what was useful once. That decay is how it "learns from" disuse — the
 * negative half of the loop — without ever deleting anything.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: a failure here must never break a capture or a
 * recall. Time is injectable so tests are deterministic.
