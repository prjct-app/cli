/**
 * Specs entity handler.
 *
 * Specs are SDD documents (migration 16, `specs` table). Apply is ADDITIVE:
 * `specStorage.applyRemote` inserts a spec missing locally and leaves an
 * existing one untouched (local data is never modified by sync), writes WITHOUT
 * re-publishing (no echo), and preserves the remote timestamps. Delete is a
 * NO-OP — a remote delete never removes a local record.
