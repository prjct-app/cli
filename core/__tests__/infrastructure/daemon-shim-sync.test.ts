/**
 * Daemon-shim ↔ manifest skip-list invariant.
 *
 * Bin-handled commands are declared ONCE in the manifest
 * (`routingMode: 'bin-only'` in command-data.ts). `bin/prjct.ts` imports
 * the derived `BIN_COMMANDS_SET`, and the shim emitted by scripts/build.js
 * evaluates the same manifest at build time (`deriveShimSkipSet`). This
 * test asserts the GENERATED shim's skip set stays a superset of the
 * manifest's bin-only commands — drift here is what made `prjct crew
 * install` run `prjct init` in 2.3.5.
