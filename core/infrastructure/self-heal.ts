/**
 * Self-heal — re-installs hooks + global CLAUDE.md when the running
 * binary's version differs from the last successful sync.
 *
 * Why this exists: `npm install -g prjct-cli` only updates the binary.
 * `scripts/postinstall.js` is best-effort and disabled on many client
 * machines by `--ignore-scripts` or corporate security policies, so we
 * cannot rely on it to refresh `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks or the
 * `<!-- prjct:start -->` block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` after an upgrade.
 *
 * The fix is runtime: every prjct invocation reads a tiny stamp file at
 * `~/.prjct-cli/state/installed-version`. If it matches the bundled
 * version → fast no-op (one fs read, microseconds). If it differs →
 * re-run `installGlobalConfig()` + `settings-installer.install()` and
 * rewrite the stamp.
 *
 * Idempotency comes from the installers themselves:
 *   - settings-installer: every entry tagged `_prjctManaged: true`,
 *     dedupes on re-run.
 *   - command-installer: rewrites the `<!-- prjct:start -->` block
 *     between markers; user content outside the markers is preserved.
 *
 * Failure mode: every step is wrapped — a self-heal failure must NEVER
 * block the user's command. Worst case the user keeps the stale config
 * until the next invocation.
