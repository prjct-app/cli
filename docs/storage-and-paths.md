# Where prjct stores data — and what to commit

A common misconception is that prjct keeps "all project data in a local
`.prjct/` directory." That is **not** how it works since v1.24.1. prjct uses a
deliberate three-tier layout that separates *committable identity* from
*per-device state* from a *regenerated readable snapshot*.

## Quickly find your project's `.prjct/` directory

The `.prjct/` directory lives in the **root of your project repo** — it is
created by `prjct init` (or automatically on the first `prjct` command in a git
repo). It is **`.gitignore`d**, which is the usual reason it seems "hidden": it
never shows up in `git status`. Locate it with one of these:

```bash
# From the project root (most common):
ls -la .prjct/
cat .prjct/prjct.config.json          # projectId + persona

# From any subdirectory of the repo — resolve the repo root first:
ls -la "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.prjct/"
cat "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.prjct/prjct.config.json"

# Confirm it exists / is initialized (doesn't print the path, just the status):
prjct doctor                           # → "✓ prjct config   initialized"

# Prove why it's invisible to git status:
git check-ignore -v .prjct             # shows the .gitignore rule that hides it
```

Programmatically, the path is always `<repoRoot>/.prjct/` and the config file is
`<repoRoot>/.prjct/prjct.config.json`. In code, prjct resolves it via
`pathManager.getLocalConfigPath(projectPath)` →
`path.join(projectPath, '.prjct', 'prjct.config.json')` (no env var, no global
lookup — it is strictly relative to the project directory).

Reading `prjct.config.json` gives you the `projectId`, which is the key to the
*other* two tiers (global SQLite, vault) described below.

---

## The three tiers

| Tier | Location | Contents | In git? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Config (identity)** | `<repo>/.prjct/prjct.config.json` | `projectId`, persona (`role`/`focus`/`mcps`/`packs`), optional `vaultPath` override | **Committable** (the `.prjct/` dir is gitignored, but you may track this one file) |
| **State (source of truth)** | `~/.prjct-cli/projects/<projectId>/prjct.db` | Tasks, memory, events, metrics, analysis — everything | **No** — per-device, never in the repo |
| **Vault (optional Obsidian export)** | `<vault-root>/<slug>/_generated/` | Markdown: architecture, patterns, decisions, gotchas, ships | **No** — **off by default**; `prjct vault on` to enable, then regenerated from state |

State (SQLite) is the source of truth, and agents read it through tools
(`prjct search` / `context memory` / `guard` / MCP `prjct_*`), not files. The
vault is an **optional human export**, off by default (`vault.mode`); when
enabled it is a rebuilt projection — never hand-edit `_generated/`; fix the
pipeline and regenerate.

## How to find each path

Resolution lives in `core/infrastructure/path-manager.ts` and
`core/infrastructure/path-manager/wiki-paths.ts`.

1. **Config:** `<repo>/.prjct/prjct.config.json`
   (`getLocalConfigPath` → `path.join(projectPath, '.prjct', 'prjct.config.json')`).
   Open it to read the `projectId`.
2. **Database:** `~/.prjct-cli/projects/<projectId>/prjct.db`
   (`getGlobalProjectPath` → `<globalBase>/projects/<projectId>`). The global base
   is `~/.prjct-cli` unless **`PRJCT_CLI_HOME`** overrides it.
3. **Vault:** `<vault-root>/<slug>/_generated/`. `prjct setup` owns the global
   `vault-root` preference, defaulting to the operating system's Documents
   directory (`~/Documents/prjct` on macOS, XDG Documents on Linux when present,
   and the user's Documents folder on Windows). `prjct setup --vault-root <path>`
   changes it. The `<slug>` is the repo directory name, lowercased, with
   non-alphanumerics collapsed to `-` (`getWikiPath`). If two repos share a
   basename the slug would collide, so a short 8-char `projectId` hash is
   appended: `<vault-root>/<slug>-<hash>/` (`getWikiPathWithProjectHash`). A
   custom `vaultPath` in `prjct.config.json` (absolute, `~`, or relative)
   overrides the global default entirely. `PRJCT_VAULT_ROOT` remains the highest
   precedence automation/test override.

`PRJCT_CLI_HOME` relocates the **entire** global store (DB + config + sync
metadata) — used for tests, sandboxes, or keeping state off the home volume.
`PRJCT_VAULT_ROOT` relocates only the readable vault and wins over the setup
preference for CI and automation.

## Why not "everything in `.prjct/`"?

Putting all state in a repo-local directory was the pre-v1.24.1 model and caused
real problems: huge gitignored blobs, JSON corruption under concurrent access,
no cross-repo memory, and merge conflicts on machine-specific data. SQLite as the
single source of truth fixed concurrency and durability; the external vault keeps
the repo clean while staying human- and agent-readable. The legacy in-repo
`.prjct/wiki/` is detected only for one-time migration.

## Team collaboration & version control

**Commit:** `.prjct/prjct.config.json`. It is small and machine-independent — a
stable `projectId` plus persona/pack declarations. Committing it means every
clone resolves to the same logical project and the same persona.

**Never commit (and prjct never puts in the repo):**

- project **state** — it lives only in per-device SQLite under `~/.prjct-cli`;
- `.prjct-state.md` — generated, user-specific session state (gitignored);
- cloud-sync credentials (`~/.prjct-cli/config/auth.json`);
- the vault — regenerated locally from state.

**So how do teammates share knowledge?** Not through git. prjct's coordination
point is **optional cloud sync**: `prjct login`, then `prjct sync` pushes/pulls
events to the backend (`api.prjct.app`) using monotonic event IDs (not
timestamps), so multiple devices/teammates converge without shared local state
and without git ever carrying project state. Solo users can ignore sync entirely
and stay fully offline — the local SQLite is complete on its own.

**Worktrees & monorepos:** sibling git worktrees of the same repo resolve to one
shared vault (slug derived from the main worktree), so parallel branches don't
fragment memory. Each distinct repo root gets its own `projectId`.
